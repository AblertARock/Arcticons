# Icon Pack Launcher compatibility 

## Supported Launchers

This is a list with launchers that support icon packs.<br>
Some launchers have more icon pack options than others, Arcticons Material You and Day & Night use newer Android features that are not supported by every launcher.

The list is work in progress, feel free to let me know if I missed something or if it isn't correct [here](https://github.com/Arcticons-Team/Arcticons/issues/1874).

🟩 = **Supported**<br>
🟥 = **Unsupported**<br>
⚙️ = **Reapply** You need to reapply the icon pack in the launchers settings<br>
🕜 = **Delayed** You will need to wait a bit<br>
⚠️ = **Old launcher** Can't test because it's made for an older Android version, it's paywalled or something else<br>
Empty = **Untested**<br>
